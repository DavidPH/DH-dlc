David's Doom Level Compiler (DH-dlc)


DH-dlc is a scripted procedural map generator for Doom and related engines. It
supports binary and textual output formats and will (hopefully) support varied
input formats.

DH-dlc outputs raw lumps that may need to be put into an appropriate archive to
be used by the target engine. Doing so is beyond the scope of this project, but
the program DH-wad exists to build WAD-format archives.
